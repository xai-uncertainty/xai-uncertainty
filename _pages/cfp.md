We invite researchers that work in machine learning and/or statistics and they are intereseted in eXplainable AI (XAI), Uncertainty quantification to submit their latest work to our Workshop.

The workshopâ€™s topics of interest include (but not limited to):

- Explainability:
  - Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)
  - Interpretable Machine Learning (IML)
  - Counterfactual Explanations
  - Global Explainability Tecnhiques
  - Feature Importance
  - Feature Effe
  - X-by-design models
  - Attacking explainability methods
  - Stability of explainability methods
  - AI model robustness and explainability
  - Explaining trade-offs between objectives (effectiveness, bias, uncertainty)
  - Explainability and privacy
  - Explainability and fairness
- Uncertainty:
  - Probabilistic Inference
  - Ensemble Methods
  - Bayesian Models
- Intersection of both:
  - Explainability methods accounting for uncertainty
  - Explainability for ML models that incorporate uncertainty
  - Explainability on Bayesian Models
  - Explainability on Ensemble Methods
  - Measuring/quantifying uncertainty and explain its sources via explainability methods
- Application on specific areas:
  - Medical Imaging
  - 



The papers submitted to the workshop must be written in English and formatted in accordance with the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). We suggest workshop papers to be prepared and submitted following [this template](https://resource-cms.springernature.com/springer-cms/rest/v1/content/19238648/data/v6).


The research or position papers should follow the format of the main research track; the submission should not exceed 14 pages for the technical content excluding the references. The author list submitted with the paper is considered final, and no changes can be made after the paper has been submitted, either during the review period or the final camera-ready stage. The inclusion of the paper in the post-proceedings is conditional upon at least one of the co-authors presenting the paper at the workshop in-person. Each paper submitted to the workshop will be subjected to a thorough double-blind peer review process, where two independent experts in the relevant field will assess its originality, quality, soundness, and relevance. To ensure a fair and unbiased review process, submitted papers must be anonymized to the best of the authors' ability. However, it is permissible to have a non-anonymous online pre-print.
