We invite researchers that work in machine learning and/or statistics and they are intereseted in eXplainable AI (XAI), Uncertainty quantification to submit their latest work to our Workshop. The workshopâ€™s topics of interest include (but not limited to) methods and applications on:

- Intersection of Explainability and Uncertainty:
  - Explainability methods that model the uncertainty of the explanation
  - Explainability for probabilistic ML models
  - Explainability on Bayesian Models
  - Explainability on Ensemble Methods
  - Explain the sources of uncertainty
- Explainability:
  - Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)
  - Interpretable Machine Learning (IML)
  - Counterfactual Explanations
  - Global/Local Explainability Tecnhiques
  - Interpretable-by-design models
  - Attacking explainability methods
  - Stability of explainability methods
  - AI model robustness and explainability
  - Explaining trade-offs between objectives (effectiveness, bias, uncertainty)
  - Explainability and privacy
  - Explainability and fairness
- Uncertainty:
  - Probabilistic Inference
  - Ensemble Methods
  - Bayesian Models
  - Conformal Prediction


Submission Instructions:

- Full Paper Track:  
The full paper track covers new innovative contributions in the area of interactive adaptive learning. If you have a new method already evaluated briefly, a new tool to simplify interaction or some new insights the community might benefit from, please submit a regular paper. The page limit is 8-16 pages (excluding references). 

- Extended Abstract Track:
The extended abstract track is ideal to discuss new ideas in the area of interactive adaptive learning. We encourage you to submit open challenges in research or industrial applications to initiate a discussion and find colleagues to collaborate with. The page limit is 2-4 pages (excluding references). 

Instructions to authors: 

- Papers can be submitted through this link: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ECMLPKDDworkshop2023/Track/3/Submission/Create 
- There will be post-workshop proceedings published by [Springer Communications in Computer and Information Science](https://www.springer.com/series/7899), in 1-2 volumes, organised by focused scope and possibly indexed by WOS. However, authors **will have the faculty to opt-in or opt-out**.
- The papers submitted to the workshop must be written in English and formatted in accordance with the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS), using [this template](https://resource-cms.springernature.com/springer-cms/rest/v1/content/19238648/data/v6).
- Up to 10 MB of additional materials (e.g. proofs, audio, images, video, data, or source code) can be uploaded with your submission. The reviewers and the program committee reserve the right to judge the paper solely on the basis of the main paper; looking at any additional material is at the discretion of the reviewers and is not required.
- All papers need to be anonymized. The authors may have a (non-anonymous) pre-print published online, but it should not be cited in the submitted paper to preserve anonymity.
